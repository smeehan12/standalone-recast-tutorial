title: Setup
---

1. Please do the following docker pull beforehand to save time during the tutorial:
~~~bash
docker pull cern/slc6-base:latest`
~~~

2. If you don't already have a grid certificate on your web browser and lxplus, please follow [these instructions](https://www.racf.bnl.gov/docs/howto/grid/installcert) to:
  * obtain a certificate,
  * export it to your browser,
  * register it with VOMS,
  * convert it to a .pem file, and
  * upload it to lxplus.
This may take some time if it is your first time, but it is time well spenty.
